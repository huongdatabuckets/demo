### **Write a problem statement**

![Untitled](Topic%201%20What%E2%80%98s%20the%20problem%20e80efbbdf1e04a8cbf7cdfd15e8aa583/Untitled%201.png)

Writing a problem statement helps you to put together the key facts of the problem, and provide a concise, accurate description of the problem. To write a problem statement, you should include key information about the who, when, where, and what of the situation, and omit the situation's causes, such as why and how, and not predict solutions as it is too early in the process to begin identifying potential solutions. This Agile technique helps you to clearly articulate what you want to achieve. Let's look at some problem statements.

### **How do you find out if a problem is worth solving?**

### **Let’s help Georgia!**

Georgia is the manager of a team of five people that processes travel expense claims. It is 15 December, and her team has to process and check 100 expense claims so that refunds can be made by 31 December—the end of the organization's financial year. Earlier in the year, Georgia had approved leave for one team member starting 19 December. This leaves her with only four people to do the work.

However, today another team member phoned in to say that her youngest daughter has chicken pox. This team member will, therefore, have to stay at home for the next 10 days to care for her child.

Georgia, however, isn’t too worried as she still has three people and they are confident about processing the claims before the deadline. But then her manager informs her that her team would have to process 100 additional expense claims before the end of the year. Georgia doesn’t know how her team is going to process 200 expense claims by 31 December with only three people on her team available to do the work.

On the next page identify the most appropriate problem statement for Georgia.

### **Is Georgia’s problem worth solving?**

**If Georgia takes no action, what will be the most likely result?**

The team will not process all the expense claims in time.

**How will this result affect her?**

- It creates high levels of stress for her.
- It requires her to work extra hours to help the team.
- It requires her to work with her management to find a solution.

**How will this result affect your organization's and its employee's objectives?**

- Many employees may not get their money on time leaving them out of pocket at a time of the year that may be expensive for many of them.
- Expenses that should be incurred in the current year will be carried over to the following year.

**If Georgia does take action, what are the risks and how big are they?**

There is a risk that other work being done may have to be put on hold so that resources can be moved to this work.

**Is it within Georgia's power to implement a solution?**

Yes.

**Does Georgia own the solution?**

Yes.

**Can Georgia define where the solution starts and stops?**

Yes. It starts in the present with 200 claims and stops by the end of the month with those claims either processed or unprocessed.
